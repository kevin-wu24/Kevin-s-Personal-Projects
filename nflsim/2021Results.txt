All ATS odds between +100 and -120
Lines are all from Thursday before Thursday Night Football game, will be updated after if necessary 
	to try and eliminate pre-game pushes or if statistics are not updated.
ML pushes occur when a game ends in a tie or when the simulation outputs a tie
ATS pushes occur when a game ends with the difference of scores equaling the chosen spread, 
	or when the simulation outputs a result where the difference of the points equals both teams' alloted points
	against the spread right before kickoff.
